## Milestones

1. **MVP** - Basic extraction from 3-5 major e-commerce sites
2. **Alpha** - Support for 10+ sites with >80% accuracy
3. **Beta** - Scaling to 50+ sites with performance optimizations
4. **v1.0** - Production-ready system with API and documentation
5. **v1.5** - Advanced features and expanded site coverage

## Discoveries & Notes

- The Crawl4AI Schema Generator works best with representative HTML samples
- LLM-based extraction is more accurate for unstructured product descriptions
- UPC/EAN codes are often stored in meta tags or data attributes rather than visible text
- Some sites require scrolling or button clicks to reveal complete product information
- Response times vary significantly across different e-commerce platforms
- Caching generated schemas significantly reduces LLM costs and improves extraction speed
- Fallback extraction using general prompts provides good recovery when schema-based extraction fails
- Using structured Pydantic models ensures consistent data validation across extraction methods
- JSON file storage provides a simple, lightweight storage option for development and testing
- Data processing standardizes units and currencies across different e-commerce platforms
- The standardize_unit function can automatically detect unit types based on provided conversions
- Batch operations significantly improve performance when handling multiple products, reducing file I/O operations
- Transaction-like behavior can be achieved in file-based storage by combining batch operations with proper error handling
- ContentFilter's wrapper approach simplifies integration with crawl4ai package while maintaining flexibility
- CSS, XPath, and regex filters provide precise DOM-based and pattern-based content extraction for targeted elements
