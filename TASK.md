## Discoveries & Notes

- The Crawl4AI Schema Generator works best with representative HTML samples
- LLM-based extraction is more accurate for unstructured product descriptions
- UPC/EAN codes are often stored in meta tags or data attributes rather than visible text
- Some sites require scrolling or button clicks to reveal complete product information
- Response times vary significantly across different e-commerce platforms
- Caching generated schemas significantly reduces LLM costs and improves extraction speed
- Fallback extraction using general prompts provides good recovery when schema-based extraction fails
- Using structured Pydantic models ensures consistent data validation across extraction methods
- JSON file storage provides a simple, lightweight storage option for development and testing
- Data processing standardizes units and currencies across different e-commerce platforms
- The standardize_unit function can automatically detect unit types based on provided conversions
- Batch operations significantly improve performance when handling multiple products, reducing file I/O operations
- Transaction-like behavior can be achieved in file-based storage by combining batch operations with proper error handling
- ContentFilter's wrapper approach simplifies integration with crawl4ai package while maintaining flexibility
- CSS, XPath, and regex filters provide precise DOM-based and pattern-based content extraction for targeted elements
- Schema validation ensures consistent structure and required fields across different extraction methods
- Schema merging combines strengths of multiple schemas for improved extraction accuracy
- Enhanced metadata extraction significantly improves the completeness of product data by capturing shipping, warranty, dimensions, material composition, and other supplementary information, providing a more comprehensive view of products
- The REST API provides a clean interface for product extraction with authentication and rate limiting
- Exporting data in CSV and JSON formats enables easy integration with other systems
- The SDK/client library provides a simple, intuitive interface for interacting with the Crawl4AI system, making it easy to integrate product extraction capabilities into custom applications with both asynchronous and synchronous APIs
- Transaction support ensures atomic operations and data consistency, particularly important when performing batch operations that need to either completely succeed or completely fail
- Deduplication logic successfully identifies duplicate products using both exact identifier matches and content similarity, allowing for flexible merging strategies (latest, most complete, or combined)
- Need to improve error handling for timeouts during extraction
- Consider implementing a caching layer for improved performance
- Schema validation needs to handle more edge cases
